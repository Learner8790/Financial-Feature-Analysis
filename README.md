How to Interact with This Project

1. Project Overview
This report documents the journey of building, training, and evaluating a sophisticated machine learning framework to address a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance: feature selection. The primary objective was not simply to create a stock prediction model, but to develop a rigorous, evidence-based system capable of sifting through a universe of potential market signals to identify the "vital few" that genuinely drive stock returns. This process is, in essence, a search for Alpha—a persistent, information-based edge.

Using five years of historical daily data for a diverse portfolio of 30 Indian stocks, we undertook a series of structured experiments. We began with a broad set of 24 engineered features and employed an automated selection algorithm to prove that an optimal, concise set of just 6 features yielded the best performance. The project navigated common real-world challenges, including a pivot from a difficult regression problem to a more robust classification task, and culminated in a final, tuned model that demonstrates a statistically significant predictive edge.

The true success of this project lies not in achieving perfect predictions, but in creating a defensible, reusable quantitative research framework that can systematically test hypotheses and deliver deep, dynamic insights into market behavior.

2. The Core Problem: Alpha, Beta, and the Curse of Dimensionality
For the Non-Technical Reader: Imagine trying to bake a cake with every ingredient in your kitchen. You'll likely end up with a mess. A good chef knows that a few key, well-chosen ingredients create the best result. The stock market is similar. There are thousands of "ingredients" (data points) available, but most are just noise. Our goal is to be the chef who scientifically finds the perfect, simple recipe.

For the Technical Reader: In quantitative finance, portfolio returns (R 
p
​
 ) are often decomposed using a single-factor model like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):

Beta (β): The return attributable to the systematic risk of the overall market's movement. It's the expected return for taking on non-diversifiable market risk.


E(R 
p
​
 )=R 
f
​
 +β(E(R 
m
​
 )−R 
f
​
 )

where R 
f
​
  is the risk-free rate and R 
m
​
  is the market's return.

Alpha (α): The excess return generated by a manager's skill or a model's informational edge, independent of the market's movement. It is the quantifiable result of a successful strategy that outperforms the benchmark, given the risk taken.


α=R 
p
​
 −[R 
f
​
 +β(R 
m
​
 −R 
f
​
 )]
The modern challenge in finding alpha is the Curse of Dimensionality. With thousands of potential features (dimensions), a machine learning model has a vast and sparse space to search for patterns. This often leads to a model discovering spurious correlations that exist purely by chance in the historical sample but have no real predictive power on out-of-sample data—a phenomenon known as overfitting.

The central question of this project is: Can we build an automated system to combat the curse of dimensionality by algorithmically determining the optimal subset of features, thereby creating a more robust model with a genuine claim to finding alpha?

3. The Experimental Laboratory: System & Architecture
We constructed a complete, end-to-end research framework to test our hypothesis.

Data Pipeline & Feature Universe
We fetched five years of daily OHLCV data for 30 NIFTY 100 stocks. To provide our model with a rich set of "senses," we engineered a universe of 24 features for each stock on each day, categorized as:

Momentum: The rate of price change over 1, 2, and 3-month lookback windows.

Volatility: The standard deviation of daily returns over 1 and 3-month windows.

Technical Indicators: A suite of standard metrics including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and ADX.

Market Context: The daily returns of key market indices to provide macroeconomic awareness.

The Feature Selection Engine: RFECV
The heart of our project is the feature selection process. We used Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), a sophisticated and computationally intensive algorithm that automates the search for the optimal feature set.

Technical Deep Dive: The Mechanics of RFECV

RFECV is an iterative wrapper method that is governed by two key components:

The Ranking Mechanism: LightGBM Gain Importance
At each step of the elimination, we need to identify the "weakest" feature. We use the feature_importance_ attribute from a trained LightGBM model, specifically with importance_type='gain'. A decision tree model works by greedily making splits that maximize a given criterion. For a regression task using Mean Squared Error (MSE), the gain from a split is the reduction in variance it achieves.


Gain=Var

​
 
​
 ⋅Var 
left
​
 + 
N 
total
​
 
N 
right
​
 
​
 ⋅Var

​
 )

The total gain for a feature is the sum of these gains across all splits where it was used, aggregated over every tree in the ensemble. A feature that consistently provides high-gain splits is considered highly influential.

The Validation Framework: Time-Series Cross-Validation
To avoid creating a model that only works on past data, we must evaluate performance on "unseen" future data. We use sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit to break our training data into 5 sequential folds. This "walk-forward" validation correctly simulates a real-world trading timeline and prevents data leakage from the future into the training set, a catastrophic error in financial modeling.

The full RFECV loop runs as follows: train on N features, evaluate, discard weakest, train on N-1 features, evaluate, and so on. This rigorously tests every possible feature subset.

The Predictive Engine: LightGBM
For our core modeling tasks, we used LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework. It is exceptionally well-suited for tabular data due to its speed, efficiency in handling large datasets, and native handling of categorical features. We used both its LGBMRegressor and LGBMClassifier variants during our experiments.

4. Our Journey: A Tale of Iterative Discovery
The final successful framework was the result of a series of structured experiments that revealed crucial insights.

Experiment 1: The Regression Baseline

Objective: Predict the exact, continuous 21-day forward return.

Result: The model produced a negative R-squared on the test set.

Diagnosis: This was a valuable and expected finding. It confirms the extreme difficulty of predicting precise, continuous stock returns. The signal is simply too weak and the noise too high for a standard regression model to capture effectively. This result provided the justification to pivot to a more tractable problem.

Experiment 2: The Classification Pivot

Objective: Simplify the problem. Instead of the exact return, predict the direction: will the stock be UP (>1%) or DOWN in 21 days?

Result: Breakthrough! The baseline classifier achieved 54% accuracy and a 0.56 ROC AUC, demonstrating a small but statistically significant predictive edge over a 50% random chance baseline.

Diagnosis: Framing the problem correctly is paramount. The model could successfully identify directional signals that were lost when trying to predict exact values.

Experiment 3: The Overfitting Trap in Hyperparameter Tuning

Objective: Improve the classifier by tuning its core hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators, learning_rate) with GridSearchCV.

Result: The "tuned" model performed slightly worse on the unseen test set (0.54 AUC).

Diagnosis: This revealed a classic machine learning pitfall. The grid search had overfit the validation sets—it found parameters that were perfect for the training data's specific quirks but failed to generalize to the truly unseen test data.

Experiment 4: The Regularization Solution

Objective: Re-run the tuning process, but this time include L1 and L2 regularization parameters (reg_alpha, reg_lambda). Regularization penalizes model complexity, forcing it to find simpler, more robust patterns.

Result: Success! The new, regularized model outperformed the baseline, achieving a final 0.57 ROC AUC score.

Diagnosis: Forcing the model to be less complex by adding a penalty term to the loss function prevented it from overfitting the training data and allowed it to generalize better, leading to improved performance on the final test set.

The Core Insight: Feature Importance is Dynamic and Regime-Dependent

The most profound finding came from analyzing the model's behavior in different market regimes. We trained separate models on days the NIFTY 50 was up ("Bullish") versus days it was down ("Bearish"). The results were stark:

On Bullish Days, Opportunity Prevails: The model's most important feature is the Upper Bollinger Band (BBU_20_2.0). Its focus is on identifying stocks that have room to run before hitting a price ceiling, suggesting an emphasis on momentum and range expansion.

On Bearish Days, Risk Dominates: The model's focus shifts dramatically to Long-Term Volatility (volatility_63d). When the market is fearful, the single most important factor is a stock's inherent riskiness. This is consistent with behavioral finance, where in down-markets, risk aversion becomes the primary driver of investment decisions.

This analysis proves that a static, single-factor model of the market is incomplete. A truly intelligent system must be aware of the prevailing regime and adapt its strategy accordingly.

6. Conclusion & Future Work
This project successfully achieved its primary objective: to develop and validate a quantitative framework for feature selection. We demonstrated that from a universe of 24 potential signals, a concise, data-driven set of 6 provides the optimal predictive power, a clear victory over the curse of dimensionality.

Our final model exhibits a persistent, statistical edge in predicting directional stock movement. However, the most valuable outcome is the framework itself—a reusable, end-to-end pipeline for rigorously testing quantitative hypotheses, navigating real-world data science challenges like model overfitting, and extracting deep, dynamic insights into the structure of financial markets.

Future work could include:

Expanding the Feature Universe: Incorporating alternative data sources like options-derived volatility, news sentiment, or order-flow data.

Advanced Models: Implementing more complex, sequence-aware models like LSTMs or Transformers to better capture time-dependencies.

Portfolio-Level Backtesting: Developing a full-fledged backtesting engine to translate the model's signals into a portfolio strategy, accounting for transaction costs, risk management, and position sizing.
